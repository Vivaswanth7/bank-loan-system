# üè¶ Bank Loan System  

Welcome to the Bank Loan System! This is a working prototype which serves as a backend system for a bank to organize customer loans, service payments, and generate account summaries. The backend is implemented in Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and the Full Stack application is finished with a simple frontend in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## ‚ú® Features  

This system supports the following salient features for basic loan management.  

* **LEND:** New loans can be issued to a bank customer. You can enter the principal amount, loan duration (in years), and interest rate. The total amount payable and monthly EMI is calculated by the system.  

* **PAYMENT:** There is flexibility in payments. Payments can be made in the form of standard EMI, in a lump sum, or both. In the case of a lump sum, the amount capped will be deducted from the outstanding amount and the new, recalibrated EMIs will be calculated.  

* **LEDGER:** For every loan, the customers can view all the transactions with all the payments, current payable balance, monthly EMI, and number of EMIs remaining.  

* **ACCOUNT OVERVIEW:** Accounts with active loans will be summarised in a list, showing original principal, total amount, EMI, total interest, amount paid till date, and remaining EMIs.
